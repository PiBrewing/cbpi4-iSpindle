# CraftBeerPi4 iSpindle Sensor Plugin

- Initial Version whichhas to be considered as beta
- Nothing needs to be changed @ the spindel except for the port.
- Change the port from 5000 to 8000 if your server is running on the same IP as your craftbeerpi3
- If your server is running on a different IP, you also need to change the IP
- Same is true for the TCP server forwarding function -> Port needs to be changed
